## Project Description

This demo showcases the "Regression on the Grassmannian based on the Monte Carlo sampling" method, which is a powerful technique for learning and predicting data on the Grassmann manifold. The method combines Bayesian inference with Monte Carlo sampling in order to fit the optimal initial conditions of the geodesic path on the Grassmannian.
